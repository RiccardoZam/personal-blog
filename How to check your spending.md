When you start thinking about investments, ETF and... became rich, you need a starting point! 

The first point is to understand the "as-is situation".
You need a place to put your expenses in order to analyze how much you are spending.

Spoiler: usually we spend a lot of money, more than we think!

You can setup a really complex spending checking strategy.
You can choose between a lot of different budgeting apps (there are a lot of really complete solutions).

My choice is simple: Google Sheets. 
I have a single document containing multiple sheets: 
- a configurable dashboard
- the spending sheet
- the gain sheet
- a more complex analytics dashboard
- net worth and investments

Of course you have to start with a single sheet.
You can have as mush columns as you want. My advice is: follow the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle.

| Date       | Name                 | Price | Category |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ----- | -------- |
| 22/07/2022 | Book "Atomic Habits" | 22.50 | Study    |
| 23/07/2022 | Sushi                | 12.70 | Food     |

You can add a lot of multiple categories like: 
- subcategory
- payiment method
- notes

My advices is to keep everything really simple.

The next step is to create the habit to add your expenses in this file. Of course now you have a simple template but you have to be patient and populate a new row every time you buy something.

Probably, create the habit of populate the spendings is the most difficult part.

At the end of the month you can check your spending (using categories you can also check the spending-per-category).

Categories are mainly personal but these are general ones working for everyone: 
-   Housing
-   Transportation
-   Food
-   Utilities
-   Clothing
-   Medical/Healthcare
-   Insurance
- Household Items/Supplies
- Personal
- Debt
- Education
- Savings
- Gifts/Donations
- Entertainment
