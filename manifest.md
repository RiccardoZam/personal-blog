# The wellbeing framework manifest

## Intro
Hi! I'm Alfonso, an italian Software Engineer. 
As you can guess from this application, I'm not only passionate about Software Engineering.

I think that, using the right tools, we can design a better life.

Since I want to became more fluent in English, I have decided to write the content in English. This is a personal choice.



## The goal of this blog
My main goal is to study and to improve myself with simple and actionable actions that lead to an improvement of our life. 

I will write about different topics like phylosophy, personal finance, career development, productivity tools and so on.

Feel free to read just the content you are interested in.

You can find 2 major differences between this platform and other blogs: 
1. I will no write blog posts, but in each page you will find a collection of useful links.
	1. In some posts, when info are redoundant or when I feel I can add something, I will insert a brief section with my thoughts about the topic
2. There are no categories, only one knowledge graph. In some nodes you can find content, so by clicking on a node you can open the content and read it.



## How to start
As you can see on top of this page, there is a mental map. By clicking on one clickable topic, you will be redirected to the releated map.

Why some items cannot be clicked? I'm creating the content in my free time so I have to prioritize what to do :) 

## For nerds
You don't understand this part? No worries, this is just for  nerds like me ;) 

### Open source
All the content is available [here](https://github.com/lokk3d/personal-blog) so feel free to open a PR to add/upadate content. Do you find dead links? Please let me know :) 


## Tech stack
Currently the tech stack used is really simple: 
- AWS S3 to store images with a public bucket
- AWS Amplify to deploy the React application
- React for the frontend
- Github is used as database (with content, config files and so on)
	- "Github as database" is the new "Excel as database" lol
- Diagrams.net for mental maps
- I'm trying to keep it simple and not use a backend for now. If needed I will use AWS Lambda (yes, I'm poor, serverless is so cheap <3 )
