## üìö Books 

### [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.it/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)
Clean Code from [Uncle Bob Martin](http://cleancoder.com/) probably is one of the best books about Software Engineering.
Please buy it and read it at least one time per year! 

The examples are written in Java but they works well in all OOP languages. 
If you are writing code in PHP (in 2022? lol), Typescript or Python no worries. All the concepts are perfectly applicable.


### [Clean Architecture](https://www.amazon.it/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164)
Clean Architecture (from the same author of Clean Code) explains architectural concepts. I advice to readt it only after Clean Code. You will have a complete overview on a great architecture model.

[Here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-architecture-a/9780134494272/) you can find a complete table of content with all the topics. I really advice to buy it. After the reading you can study also the [Hexagonal Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)) to have a more complete overview


### [Modern Software Engineering](https://www.amazon.it/Modern-Software-Engineering-Discipline-Development/dp/0137314914)
Modern Software Engineering from David Farley is, in my opinion, an awesome book! The first topic explored is "Are we engineers or not?".  Then are expressed a lot of engineering mental models and tools (and how we have to use them in Software Engineering). 

In the second part you can find a lot of strategies on how to learn faster and get feedbacks.
Then there in an entire section on how to manage complexity.

I think that this book should be readed after Clean Code. 


### [DevOps](https://www.amazon.it/DevOps-integrare-development-operations-migliorare/dp/8850334508)
What is DevOps? How to establish a DevOps culture in your company and in your team? What are the best patterns? 

This book is just an introduction to a complex and really important topic. 
Another releated book that I will read in the next months is [Accelerate: The Science Behind Devops: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations](https://www.amazon.it/Accelerate-Building-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339/)

### [Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code](https://www.amazon.it/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0134757599)
I think a refactoring course have to be mandatory in every University! Usually you learn how to write working code but when the application scale up, usually the code becames more complex, unstable and really hard to update.

To fight this we have to change our coding process. After the "writing" part of our work process, we need to put in action the "refactoring" part. You can read this book when you want (there are not prerequisites) but I advice you to read it now! 

### [Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://www.amazon.it/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321/)
This is a really technical book (not for junior developers). Currently applications have to handle a lot of data and understand how to model and handle data is a key skill if you want to became a senior software engineer.

In this book you will find a lot of informazion about databases, streams, data analytics (from the point of view of a Software engineer). You will deeply understand the difference between relational databases and document databases (and also graph databases).

There is also an interesting section about data representation.

I advice you to read this book only if you have already worked with one or more types of databases.

### [Artificial Intelligence: A modern approach](https://www.amazon.it/Artificial-Intelligence-Modern-Approach-Global/dp/1292401133)
Did you know? Artificial Intelligence is not just Machine Learning! There are a lot of different and interesting topics to cover! I have used this book to prepare myself for an University exam and I have loved it. There is also the second part of the book (probably I'll buy it in the next months!).

In the exam we have also worked on a genetic algorithm from scratch in plain Java. You can find the entire project [here](https://github.com/lokk3d/Progetto-IS-FIA).
