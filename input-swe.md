## üìö Books 

### [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.it/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)
Clean Code from [Uncle Bob Martin](http://cleancoder.com/) probably is one of the best books about Software Engineering.
Please buy it and read it at least one time per year! 

The examples are written in Java but they works well in all OOP languages. 
If you are writing code in PHP (in 2022? lol), Typescript or Python no worries. All the concepts are perfectly applicable.


### [Clean Architecture](https://www.amazon.it/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164)
Clean Architecture (from the same author of Clean Code) explains architectural concepts. I advice to readt it only after Clean Code. You will have a complete overview on a great architecture model.

[Here](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-architecture-a/9780134494272/) you can find a complete table of content with all the topics. I really advice to buy it. After the reading you can study also the [Hexagonal Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)) to have a more complete overview
