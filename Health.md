Early diagnosis is important, but can you go one better? Can you reduce your risk of getting cancer in the first place? It sounds too good to be true, but it's not. Scientists at the Harvard School of Public Health estimate that up to 75% of American cancer deaths can be prevented. The 10 commandments of cancer prevention are:

  

1. *Avoid tobacco* 

2. *Eat properly.* Reduce your consumption of saturated fat and red meat, which may increase the risk of colon cancer and a more aggressive form of prostate cancer. Increase your consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.

3. *Exercise regularly.* 

4. *Stay lean.* Obesity increases the risk of many forms of cancer.

5. *If you choose to drink, limit yourself to an average of one drink a day.* 

6. *Avoid unnecessary exposure to radiation.* Get medical imaging studies only when you need them. Check your home for residential radon, which increases the risk of lung cancer. Protect yourself from ultraviolet radiation in sunlight, which increases the risk of melanomas and other skin cancers

7. *Avoid exposure to industrial and environmental toxins* such as asbestos fibers, benzene, aromatic amines, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).

8. *Avoid infections that contribute to cancer*, including hepatitis viruses, HIV, and the human papillomavirus. Many are transmitted sexually or through contaminated needles.

9. *Make quality sleep a priority.* Admittedly, the evidence linking sleep to cancer is not strong. But poor and insufficient sleep increases is associated with weight gain, which is a cancer risk factor.

10. *Get enough vitamin D.* Many experts now recommend 800 to 1,000 IU a day, a goal that's nearly impossible to attain without taking a supplement. Although protection is far from proven, evidence suggests that vitamin D may help reduce the risk of prostate cancer, colon cancer, and other malignancies.

11. Protect the skin from the sun

12. Know the family medical history

13. get regular cancer screenings

14. Protect against HPV infection
